    <h4>Amazon Shopping Data (Local Storage)</h4>
    <p>When you use the "Login with Amazon" feature, the Application retrieves specific shopping history data to generate your summary. <strong>This data is stored and processed locally on your Device. It is not collected by the Company's servers.</strong></p>

    <h4>Usage Data</h4>
    <p>Usage Data is collected automatically when using the Service. This may include Your Device's IP address, device type, operating system, and other diagnostic data. This data is used solely for app stability and performance analytics.</p>

    <h2>Use of Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p>The Company may use Personal Data for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>To provide and maintain our Service:</strong> Including generating your shopping summary locally on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>To manage Your requests:</strong> To attend and manage Your requests to Us.</li>
        <li><strong>For other purposes:</strong> We may use anonymous Usage Data for data analysis, identifying usage trends, and determining the effectiveness of our campaigns.</li>

    <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> The Company will retain anonymous Usage Data for internal analysis purposes to improve the Application.</p>

    <h2>Transfer of Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p><strong>Amazon Shopping Data is NOT transferred to the Company.</strong> It is transferred from Amazon directly to Your Device via the API. Usage Data (metadata) may be processed at the Company's operating offices.</p>

    <h2>Delete Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p>You have the right to delete the Personal Data that We have collected about You.</p>
    <p><strong>How to Delete Amazon Data:</strong> Since this data is stored locally, You can delete it entirely by simply <strong>uninstalling the Application</strong> or clearing the App's storage in your phone settings. We do not hold a copy of this data on our servers.</p>

    <h2>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h2>
    <h3>Business Transactions</h3>
    <p>If the Company is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, Your Personal Data (if any is held by us) may be transferred. Note that local data on your device remains under your control.</p>

    <h3>Law enforcement</h3>
    <p>Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities.</p>

    <h2>Security of Your Personal Data</h2>
    <p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us. Specifically, by keeping your shopping data on your local device, we minimize the risk of server-side data breaches. However, remember that no method of electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
